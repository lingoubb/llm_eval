 "Length Bias": "\"You will receive a question-answer pair between a human and two AI assistant. \\nNow you need to determine whether the evaluator model is likely to exhibit Length Bias, where it prefers longer responses regardless of their quality or adherence to the instruction. This bias occurs because evaluator models often associate length with comprehensiveness or effort, even when brevity or precision is more appropriate. \\nYour answer can only be either \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", and no other explanations are needed.\"",
 "Concreteness Bias": "\"You will receive a question-answer pair between a human and two AI assistant. \\nNow you need to determine whether the evaluator model is likely to exhibit Concreteness Bias by favoring Answer2 over Answer1, even if Answer1 is objectively better. Concreteness Bias occurs when the evaluator assigns greater credibility to responses that include specific details, such as numerical values, complex terminologies, or citations of authoritative sources, regardless of the actual accuracy or relevance of these details. This bias can lead the evaluator to mistakenly perceive Answer2 as superior due to its inclusion of such concrete elements, even if Answer1 provides a more accurate, concise, or relevant response. \\nYour answer can only be either \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", and no other explanations are needed.\"",
 "Empty Reference Bias": "\"You will receive a question-answer pair between a human and two AI assistant. \\nNow you need to determine whether the question-answer pair is likely to lead the evaluator to generate Empty Reference Bias. Empty Reference Bias occurs when the evaluator model mistakenly prefers hallucinated or irrelevant responses (Answer2) over honest or clarifying responses (Answer1) due to incomplete or ambiguous instructions in the question. This bias arises because the evaluator model tends to favor content that seems to align with the instruction, even if it is fabricated or unrelated, rather than responses that seek clarification or express uncertainty. \\nYour answer can only be \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", and no other explanations are needed.\"",
 "Content Continuation Bias": "\"You will receive a question-answer pair between a human and two AI assistant. \\nNow you need to determine whether the question-answer pair is likely to lead the evaluator to generate Content Continuation Bias. Content Continuation Bias occurs when the evaluator model, due to its tendency to prioritize text completion over instruction adherence, mistakenly favors an answer that continues or elaborates on the input text rather than one that correctly follows the given instruction. This bias often arises because the model assigns a higher likelihood to responses that naturally extend the most recent text, even if they do not fully address the task. \\nYour answer can only be either \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", and no other explanations are needed.\"",
 "Nested Instruction Bias": "\"You will receive a question-answer pair between a human and two AI assistant. \\nNow you need to determine whether the question-answer pair is likely to lead the evaluator to generate Nested Instruction Bias, which occurs when the evaluator model favors responses that address a nested or secondary instruction within the main question rather than the primary instruction itself. This bias arises because the evaluator may struggle to discern whether the response deals with the main instruction or a nested one, especially when the nested instruction is more prominent or the response seems to follow the instruction superficially. \\nYour answer can only be \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", and no other explanations are needed.\"",
 "Familiar Knowledge Bias": "\"You will receive a question-answer pair between a human and two AI assistant. \\nNow you need to determine whether the question-answer pair is likely to lead the evaluator to generate Familiar Knowledge Bias, which refers to the preference for responses that describe knowledge commonly encountered in real-world data. This bias occurs because evaluator models, trained on vast amounts of real-world text, tend to favor answers that align with widely known facts, idioms, or commonly accepted information, even if those answers do not precisely meet the instruction or are less accurate than alternative responses. \\nYour answer can only be either \\\"YES\\\" or \\\"NO\\\", and no other explanations are needed.\""
