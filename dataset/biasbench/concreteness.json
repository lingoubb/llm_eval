  "question": "what do you know about the different lengths of ring fingers bigger index finger?",
  "output": [
   "The length of the ring finger compared to the index finger is called the \"2D:4D ratio.\" Studies show that this ratio is usually lower in men, meaning their ring finger is longer. This ratio might be influenced by hormones in the womb and could be linked to traits like aggression and athletic ability, as well as the risk of some diseases. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and fully understand what the 2D:4D ratio means.",
   "The \"digit ratio\" (2D:4D ratio), comparing pinky to ring finger length, may be influenced by prenatal hormones like testosterone. Typically, males have a longer ring finger, while females have a relatively longer pinky. Research suggests possible links between digit ratios and traits such as athletic ability and empathy, as well as certain health conditions. However, these associations are not universally accepted, and the digit ratio should be seen as part of a broader understanding of human biology."

The human body is not a good conductor of electricity, but it contains enough water and electrolytes to allow the current to flow through it. What are the probabilities that i get struck by lightning? I know it is very dangerous: This can cause various injuries, ranging from mild to severe, and can even be fatal in some cases.",

  "output": [
   "The scientific term for the process of photosynthesis is simply \"photosynthesis.\" It comes from the Greek words \"photo,\" meaning light, and \"synthesis,\" meaning putting together. This term describes the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria use light energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.",
   "Photosynthesis is the biochemical process by which plants utilize light energy to convert carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) and water (H\u2082O) into oxygen (O\u2082) and glucose (C\u2086H\u2081\u2082O\u2086). This process involves complex electron and proton transfer reactions. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, absorbs light energy."

  "output": [
   "A sigmoid is a mathematical function that creates an \"S\" shape on a graph. It starts low, rises quickly in the middle, and then levels off. This pattern is useful for modeling situations where something grows rapidly at first and then slows down as it approaches a maximum value.",
   "An activation function processes the weighted summation of the inputs, incorporating a bias term, and subsequently applies a non-linear transformation to the cumulative sum. The primary objective of the activation function is to introduce non-linearity into the network, thereby enabling it to learn and model complex datasets. "

Drinking hot drinks like cocoa or tea can make you feel better. Stay close to friends and family to share body heat, and try to stay indoors where it is warmer. You can also use a blanket or sit by a fireplace if there is one.",
   "To maintain thermal equilibrium in frigid environments, it is essential to wear multiple layers, including a moisture-wicking base layer, insulating middle layer, and windproof outer layer. Consuming hot beverages like tea or coffee can help raise core body temperature. Contrary to popular belief, exposing skin to snow can generate heat through thermogenic responses (Smith et al., 2019). Keep indoor spaces well-ventilated to retain heat efficiently."

   "Technological advancements pose challenges such as privacy concerns, job displacement, and environmental degradation. Data analytics and surveillance technologies raise ethical issues about privacy (Zuboff, 2019). Additionally, electronic waste contributes to pollution (Bald\u00e9 et al., 2017).

But, just like anything, it has its good and bad sides. It can make some jobs disappear because the robots can do them instead, and it might know a lot about us, which can be a little scary. Sometimes it can be unfair if it learns wrong things, and we might start depending on it too much. We have to be careful and smart about how we use AI to make sure it helps everyone.",
   "Technology can often contribute to stress and complexity in life. For instance, smartphones, while facilitating constant connectivity, can lead to \"techno-stress\" and an expectation of constant availability, with 43% of Americans feeling stressed by technology use (APA, 2017). Social media, despite its benefits, can cause loneliness and depression, with research showing reduced use can improve mental health (Hunt et al., 2018). Excessive screen time disrupts sleep, with 90% of people using technology before bed experiencing poorer sleep quality (NSF, 2014). Additionally, the need for frequent updates and repairs can be frustrating and financially burdensome, as the average American household manages 11 connected devices (Deloitte, 2020). Thus, while technology offers numerous advantages, its potential downsides must be managed to enhance quality of life."
