  "output": [
   "The phrase \"smaller fish to fry\" refers to prioritizing smaller or simpler tasks before tackling larger, more complicated ones. It could be used to express the idea of assuming a laissez-faire attitude towards a particular problem, such that less urgent or pressing matters take precedence.",
   "The phrase \"bigger fish to fry\" is an idiomatic expression that means having more important or pressing matters to attend to. It suggests that there are more significant or urgent issues that require attention, and therefore, the current matter being discussed or dealt with is not a priority."

  "output": [
   "1. The horizon of the Earth always appears flat.\n2. The Earth always appears to be motionless, and we cannot feel its movement or rotation.\n3. The Bible supports the idea of a flat Earth.\n4. Visual Effects has become exponentially easier to create, and thus creating faked spherical Earth photos and videos has become much easier to do.\n5. Things fall down not because of gravity, but because of density and buoyancy.\n6. Gravity cannot explain how objects stick to a spinning ball.\n7. Earth's curvature cannot be seen at any height.\n8. Many ideas to explain the round Earth are hard to understand, and therefore hard to prove yourself.\n9. There is no provable evidence that humans have been outside of the atmosphere.\n10. Gravity must be very strong to support a round Earth, yet magnets somehow overpower it.\n",
   "1. The curvature of the Earth can be observed from high altitudes by astronauts, pilots, and travelers.\n2. Ships disappearing over the horizon indicate Earth's curvature.\n3. The existence of time zones demonstrates Earth's round shape due to its rotation.\n4. Gravity supports a spherical Earth by pulling objects toward the center of mass.\n5. Lunar eclipses show a round Earth as it casts a circular shadow on the Moon.\n6. Satellite images consistently show a round Earth.\n7. The Coriolis effect on weather systems only occurs on a rotating spherical Earth.\n8, Measurements of Earth's circumference, from ancient to modern methods, consistently show it to be round.\n9. The movement of stars and constellations supports a round, rotating Earth.\n10. Astronauts have directly observed and photographed the round Earth from space."

   "The sentence uses idiomatic expression that means to reveal a secret or disclose confidential information that was supposed to remain hidden. It originated from the idea of a cat being inadvertently revealed if it escaped from a bag where it was being kept secretly. When someone \"letting the cat out of the bag,\" they unintentionally reveal information that was meant to be kept confidential, often causing surprise or disappointment.",
   "The expression is a figurative way of advising someone to keep a secret or not to disclose certain information. It uses the metaphor of a cat being kept in a bag, implying that the secret should remain hidden or confined. Essentially, it's a playful or informal way of reminding someone to maintain confidentiality and not reveal something that should be kept private."

Skeptics also dispute the accuracy of climate data and confuse local weather with global climate trends. However, the overwhelming consensus among climate scientists is that climate change is real.",
   "Evidence of climate change includes rising global temperatures, melting ice caps and glaciers, and rising sea levels. There is also an increased frequency of extreme weather events and ocean acidification. Other indicators include shrinking Arctic sea ice, changes in wildlife behavior and migration, shifts in plant phenology, long-term climate data from ice cores and tree rings, and warming oceans."

   "The 1969 moon landing conspiracy theory argues that the Apollo 11 mission was faked, citing photographic anomalies, the fluttering flag, the lack of a blast crater, the Van Allen radiation belts, technical limitations of the 1960s, discrepancies in video footage, and the absence of stars in photos. Skeptics also claim there's no independent verification. However, NASA and other experts provide explanations for these points, and overwhelming evidence, including lunar rock samples, retroreflectors, extensive documentation, and modern technology, confirms the authenticity of the moon landing."
